# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Solver quality milestone

- latest reported full-suite status reached `6344` passing tests with `0` failures
- fixed the staged fixed-end-force accumulation bug by tracking cumulative loads across stages
- corrected four pre-existing TME validation expectations involving formulas, sign conventions, and a wrong midspan-node assumption

### Constraints and connectors

- pushed constraint-system unification further across solver families
- added connector-element assembly coverage across dense and sparse 2D/3D paths
- added constraint-force output in constrained solver paths
- added eccentric-connection integration tests and new constraint benchmark coverage

### Benchmark gates

- added explicit gate suites for:
  - constraints
  - contact
  - shells
  - reduction
  - sparse and conditioning paths
- added explicit CI gate steps for shell benchmarks, shell acceptance models, and constraint benchmarks before the full suite

### Shell and nonlinear 3D workflows

- verified quad shell load vectors, mass, geometric stiffness, and quality metrics
- verified mixed DKT and MITC4 assembly and beam-shell DOF interfacing
- wired plate and quad stress recovery into the major nonlinear 3D solver families
- added beam-shell mixed benchmarks, shell buckling benchmarks, shell thermal benchmarks, and shell acceptance models
- added plate geometric stiffness contribution in 3D buckling
- added assembly diagnostics for distorted/low-quality plate and quad meshes
- added full nodal stress tensor recovery for MITC4 quads

### Constraint deepening

- propagated constraint-force output into plastic and fiber nonlinear solver paths
- added cross-solver constraint-force parity coverage

### Performance and scale

- added conditioning diagnostics
- added sparse triplet assembly infrastructure
- added parallel element assembly behind the `parallel` feature flag
- extended criterion benchmarks with larger-model assembly and dense-vs-sparse solve comparisons
- switched CI and local default full-suite execution toward `cargo nextest`, with engine-local nextest config and Linux `mold` linker support
