# Benchmark accuracy findings

This test-owned ledger records accuracy failures without changing runtime diagnostics.
The production registry is [`engine/src/known_issues.rs`](../../src/known_issues.rs).
It currently has no open shell entry. These findings need solver-owner triage before any
runtime registry entry is added; no runtime issue number is implied here.

## MH-MITC4-DISTORTION

On the MacNeal–Harder straight cantilever (6 × 1, full root clamp), production MITC4 misses
the page's strict 2% accuracy target for both trapezoidal and parallelogram meshes:

| Mesh | Load | Reference | Computed | Relative error |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Trapezoidal | Out of plane | 0.4321 | 0.4162053612497649 | 3.678463% |
| Trapezoidal | In plane | 0.1081 | 0.008443013508022026 | 92.189627% |
| Parallelogram | Out of plane | 0.4321 | 0.42257240188170075 | 2.204952% |
| Parallelogram | In plane | 0.1081 | 0.010379694543545988 | 90.398062% |

Native regression gates require the two regular MITC4 cases to retain the strict 2% accuracy target. Each of these four known failures has a separate two-sided displacement bound of ±0.1% around the computed value above. These bounds detect numerical drift; satisfying them is still an accuracy failure. The perturbation test rejects degraded, zero and non-finite measurements.

Native and production WASM agree. Reproduce with `shells macneal_harder::browser_cases`
and `research/benchmarks/macneal-harder-1985/wasm/check.mjs`. Inputs, references and the
accuracy threshold are in `macneal_harder.json`. These measurements are evidence of the
specified mesh's accuracy, not proof of a new implementation defect. Existing solid-shell
regression floors document related distortion sensitivity and remain unchanged.

## MH-REFERENCE-PROVENANCE

Geometry of the straight cantilever is Fig. 4, p. 7; patch geometry is Fig. 2, p. 5, and
patch boundary fields are Table 2, p. 10. A preview of the paper supports these locators.
The numerical tables were not accessible. Values 0.4321 and 0.1081 retain provenance from
`solid_shell_locking.rs`; verify the numerical table/page against the full paper before
claiming a verified transcription. Frame cases are explicitly analytical adaptations.
